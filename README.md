3. Set your threads
4. It will dump all top 100 wallets found in each CA to top_trader_addresses.txt, if the wallet is found in multiple top 100's, it'll save to repeated_addresses.txt

Updates (17/08/24)<br><br>
1. Added tls_client (pip install tls_client) due to some retard on Twitter showing off GMGN endpoints leading them to add CFv2 Captcha, easy bypass though
